## File Structure

Here I have created four separate "projects", one for each of the Arduinos. The `/utils` directory should contain header files that contain definitions (ðŸ¤®) for common functions like packet communication, type definitions, etc. These header files then can be included in the "main" `.ino` file in each project.

Let's keep it clean out there ðŸ’ª.
